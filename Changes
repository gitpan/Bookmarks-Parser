        [Bookmarks::Opera] Fixed two fairly bad bugs:
          * items separated by lines containing leading spaces (instead of empty)
            were not parsed correctly, skipping to the next bookmark
          * last item wouldn't be parsed if there wasn't an empty last line

        [Bookmarks::Opera] Updated to handle all Opera custom properties.
